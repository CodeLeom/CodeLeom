I create technical contents which include blog posts, video tutorials, guest authoring and open source contributions mainly on documentation and front-end web development. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that is as public as possible. You can see a full list of my articles on [leomofthings.com](https://leomofthings.com). The website is currently a work in progress which will soon include a revamp of my portfolio. If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to send a [tip](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/leomofthings), give me a shout out [@leomofthings](https://twitter.com/leomofthings), drop some â™¥ on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@leomofthings/).

### Give Back

I love open source and community. I am not yet a heavy contributor to any open-source projects, but I really like the boyscout rule. I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with. This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the project. I ðŸ’• a good onboarding documentation with good example. Hence, anytime I found one lacking, I contribute to improve it.

### My Contents ðŸŒ±

I write blog posts, most of which you will find on my personal website [leomofthings.com](https://leomofthings.com) and [https://medium.com/@leomofthings](https://medium.com/@leomofthings).

I write about things I am familiar with, things that confuse people that I mentor, and things that I am learning. Day to day I make things for the **web** using **React** and **love**.
